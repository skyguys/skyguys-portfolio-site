--Readme document for AEDAN MAGSOMBOl, anmagsom@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

I did not ignore any warnings.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

Around 12-15 hours.

5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

I used a lot of W3 Schools and small snippets from ChatGPT, such as asking if there was a 
specific CSS tag for something I wanted to do. For example, I learned that max-width and max-height
were a thing through this.

I also used some boilerplate Bootstrap code, which I did modify and simplify to my use case.

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

I did not discuss anything with classmates.

7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

JavaScript must be enabled :)
